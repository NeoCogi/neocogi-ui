# Changelog

## 0.8.0 (unreleased)

Version 0.8 is a deliberate retained-API redesign. It unifies application authoring, input,
events, surfaces, menus, and rendering around uniquely owned retained values. Superseded alpha APIs
and compatibility layers were removed.

### Retained authoring and events

- `Node` is the sole mountable owner of a widget or container. Built-in constructors return a typed
  weak handle beside that node for later state access.
- Concrete widgets now own their semantic state, typed event ports, measurement, update, and paint
  behavior. `LeafWidget` and `ContainerWidget` define the two retained layout roles.
- `Context` owns input ordering, surface lifetime, rendering, and the application event dispatcher.
  `update_ui` and `update_ui_state` are the synchronization boundary for input and programmatic
  mutations.
- `WidgetEventPortHandle<E>` connects through one typed `subscribe(port, callback)` API; callbacks
  receive application state, `Ui`, and the concrete event after retained widget borrows end.
- `Widget::update` reports `Change::Changed` or `NoChange` for geometry inputs. Context updates
  automatically commit layout; shared state, update eligibility/order, and observational painting
  remain explicit widget/application author responsibilities.
- Custom containers receive an opaque weak `ChildrenHandle` through `bind_children`. Checked edits
  preserve rejected owners and automatically invalidate geometry. Standalone widgets implement
  `From<Parameters>`; redundant builder marker traits and stateless builders were removed.
- `FileDialog` is an application-owned component with native-path requests/results and typed
  completion. Directory reads are transactional and fallible; hidden or destroyed dialog surfaces
  settle pending requests through the same event dispatcher.

### Surfaces, menus, and input

- One `SurfaceForest` owns windows, structural child windows, dialogs, application popups, and menu
  popups. Parent edges define lifetime and one active popup path defines transient visibility.
- Stable `WindowHandle`, `PopupHandle`, and `MenuItemHandle` capabilities reject destroyed, stale,
  or foreign targets. Failed owned-surface creation returns its unchanged input for retry.
- Structural child windows inherit their family layer and may clip their complete output to the
  parent's application content.
- Declarative menu bars and standalone menu popups compile directly into manager-owned menu
  surfaces. Checked item access supports live labels, enabled state, shortcut hints, and check/radio
  marks.
- Logical key events, persistent focus, wrapping Tab traversal, Ctrl+F6 window cycling, popup Escape
  handling, and F10/Alt menu navigation now share one backend-neutral keyboard contract.
- Forest key lookup, child adjacency, inherited policy, and visibility are derived from its single
  authoritative node vector. Normal geometry phases reuse that projection instead of rescanning
  ancestry and all potential children for each surface.
- Native/browser hosts forward explicit cancellation and committed text. Browser wheel units,
  button chords, pointer capture, and composition use one owned input bridge with documented limits.

### Rendering, themes, and widgets

- `Painter` records backend-neutral work into a display list. `RendererBackend::Frame<'a>` provides
  one exclusive submission frame, and typed custom-render callbacks receive that selected frame
  directly.
- `RendererFrame::finish` explicitly returns recording/submission/presentation errors; dropping a
  frame abandons pending work. Native surface backends retain their SDL window owner.
- Glow drawing shares UI state restoration and upload preparation. WGPU validates device texture
  limits and resolves error scopes before replacing retained resources. Vulkan uses Ash's native
  constructors directly, and unused renderer code no longer hides behind blanket warnings.
- Skin installation requires all application catalog IDs in the candidate atlas; compatible
  derivation preserves IDs across allocation changes. Slider setters stay silent and do not snap
  programmatic values during later eventless updates.
- `ContextFrame::render_ui` is paint-only and rejects missing, stale, or dimension-mismatched UI
  commits before acquiring a backend frame.
- `Skin` provides typed role/state visuals, stable font and icon references, configurable window
  chrome, and atomic skin/atlas replacement. Strict JSON themes compile before atlas construction.
- Original Windows 3.11, Windows 95, and Mac OS 9 themes are bundled and selectable in `demo-full`.
- A WebGL 2 canvas renderer, browser-native animation loop, local build/server script, and GitHub Pages
  workflow make the complete demo available in the browser.
- Public retained scrolling now includes `Scrollbar`, `ScrollArea`, and a scrollable `TextArea`.
- Demo atlases use one recipe for runtime construction, normal Cargo host generation, and export.
  The stale external-atlas metadata path and nested Cargo build were removed.
- The examples and guides were updated for the 0.8 contracts. Standalone guides now participate in
  doctesting, with complete Rust examples compiled during documentation tests.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-05-25

Version 0.7 completed the first retained migration by moving root lifetime, interaction identity,
and frame traversal into `Context` instead of requiring applications to resubmit every root each
frame.

- Applications registered windows, dialogs, and popups in `Context`, then controlled visibility,
  options, and explicit destruction through retained handles.
- Private runtime identity and typed widget events replaced public interaction lookup.
- Widget execution was split into explicit measure, update, and paint phases.
- Retained layout gained weighted sibling sizing, fractional sizing, scroll areas, and corrected root
  chrome, popup, dialog, and resize behavior.
- Rendering was unified behind `Painter`, `DisplayList`, `Renderer`, and `RendererBackend`; external
  textures and atlas inputs gained stricter validation.
- Glow, Vulkan, and WGPU examples adopted the same retained-root lifecycle.

## 0.6.x

Version 0.6 introduced retained `WidgetTree` authoring on top of the earlier per-frame root loop.

- Retained trees replaced immediate closure-based widget authoring.
- Widgets gained persistent state, measurement, typed events, and custom painting.
- Custom-render leaves received geometry and input for application rendering.
- Atlas construction and generated/external data gained multi-font support.
- Version 0.6.1 made runtime atlas construction the demo default and prebuilt embedding opt-in.

## 0.5

- Widget identity moved to pointer-based IDs and explicit stateful widget instances.
- Layout was split into a shared engine and specialized row/stack flows, including directional
  stacks and weighted or fractional sizing.
- Text editing, scrollbar behavior, file-dialog layout, and PNG decoding were corrected.
- Container styling used shared `Rc<Style>` values and window chrome state moved into `Window`.
- WGPU example rendering and custom graphics demos were added.

## 0.4

- Stateful built-in controls replaced the legacy immediate widget calls.
- Widget measurement and input were routed through a shared execution context.
- Persistent widget identity tracked focus and hover.
- Dialogs, file-dialog interaction, atlas handling, and scrollbar tests were expanded.
- Styles became shared across containers and panels.

## 0.3

- Standard-library collections and parsing replaced the earlier custom equivalents.
- Container layout, clip stacks, and command recording were redesigned.
- Atlas building, generated Rust data, external PNG data, images, and multiple fonts were added.
- Custom drawing and 3D pass-through rendering gained mouse, keyboard, text, and drag input.
- Dialogs and the file dialog were introduced.
- The calculator, simple example, and full rendering demo established the example suite.
